Robert and Lisa Smith have two beautiful children.
Amy is nine and Ross is seven.
The Smiths' house has two floors.
The children's rooms are upstairs, and the parents' bedroom is downstairs.
Lisa's room is always clean while Ross's room is always messy.
The Smiths' lives are very busy this week.
Ross's sports teams all have games.
Amy's ballet class has a recital and Robert's car is in the shop.
So, the Smiths are trying to get everything done with only Lisa's car.
Today, they've been to school, practice, rehearsal, the grocery store, and the veterinarian's office.
Mind you, they aren't finished yet. They'll be busy until late tonight and, tomorrow, they'll do it all again.
