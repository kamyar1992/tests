# Polymorphism
# https://realpython.com/oop-in-python-vs-java/

a = 2
b = 3.14
c = 'test'

# methods of the objects define their behaviours
# none of the a, b and c objects has the print methods, but we can print them because every object in python inherit
# from a class that is named Object.
# Object class has a method that enable them to be printed __str__(). thus, inheritance make Polymorphism.
print(a)
print(b)
print(c)

# two ways for implementing Polymorphism:
# composition, Aggregation

# delegation
